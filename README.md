# A-Frame with TypeScript and Webpack starter project
A starter/boilerplate project for anyone looking to use [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) with TypeScript and Webpack using [aframe-typescript-class-components](https://github.com/illustspace/aframe-typescript-class-components). I've tried to 
keep things simple with the code hopefully being self explanatory with comments where necessary.

Please ⭐️ if this was useful to help others find this project.

## Demo
There's not much to see, but proof that it works in the wild can be seen here https://danb.io/aframe-typescript. 


## Usage
The code is offered as UNLICENSED meaning you can use it without limitation and without referencing this repo.

## Building and running
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn serve`
3. Navigate to https://0.0.0.0:5555 in your browser (default port)

## Deploying to production
1. `yarn install` (if you haven't already)
2. `yarn build`
3. Files for hosting will then appear in a `dist/` directory
